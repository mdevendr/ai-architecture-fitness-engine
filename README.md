## AI-Driven Architecture Fitness & Modernization Score Engine

A continuous, event-driven architecture scoring and modernization advisory system powered by AWS-native signals and Amazon Bedrock.

This repository contains the architecture blueprint for an autonomous engine that evaluates cloud workloads, detects modernization opportunities, and generates architecture fitness scores – using AWS telemetry and AI-driven reasoning.

Note: This is an architecture-only repository.
Implementation modules will be added in future versions.

## Overview

The engine automates architecture review by:
- Analysing workload signals (CloudWatch metrics, Config, Cost Explorer, usage patterns)
- Evaluating modernization opportunities
- Scoring cost efficiency, reliability, resilience, maintainability, and scalability
- Producing AI-driven recommendations using Bedrock
- Triggering periodic evaluations using EventBridge Scheduler
- Orchestrating a multi-step workflow using Step Functions

This repo contains the **architecture** only — *no full implementation is provided yet*.

## High-Level Architecture

### Components
- **Cloud Signals Layer** – Autonomous metrics, logs, and config-based signals generated by native AWS services.
- **EventBridge Pipes** – Filters workloads based on important signal changes.
- **Signal Buffer (SQS)** – Stores filtered events for burst protection and durable processing.
- **EventBridge Scheduler** – Triggers periodic full-account analysis.
- **Step Functions (Evaluator & Orchestrator)** – Controls workflow, retries, orchestration, and final scoring.
- **AWS Lambda (AI Orchestrator)** – Calls Amazon Bedrock with workload metadata.
- **Amazon Bedrock** – Produces the modernization score & recommendations.
- **DynamoDB** – Stores evaluation metadata, history, and recommendations.
- **S3** – Stores architecture documents, score reports, exports, and diagrams.

##  Workflow

### Cloud Signals → EventBridge Pipes
Each workload emits operational, security, and performance signals:
```
CloudWatch → EventBridge Pipe → (Filter + Transform) → SQS
```

### Periodic Evaluation
EventBridge Scheduler triggers Step Functions to:
- Pull signals from SQS
- Load architecture metadata from DDB
- Invoke AI analysis
- Store updated scores

### AI Processing (Lambda + Bedrock)
Lambda prepares:
- Resource configuration
- Metrics summary
- Historical performance context

Bedrock produces:
- Modernization score (0–100)
- Architecture fitness findings
- Recommended patterns (Serverless, EDA, CQRS, Sidecar, SQS buffering, DAX, etc.)

## Scoring Model

### Cost Efficiency
- Idle compute %
- Right-sizing
- Storage lifecycle efficiency
- Data transfer optimisation

### Reliability & Resilience
- Multi-AZ readiness
- DR posture
- Error rate trends
- Retry/backoff patterns

### Scalability
- Auto scaling policies
- Concurrency behaviour
- Queue depth efficiency
- Burst handling readiness

### Maintainability
- Complexity level
- Modularity
- Pattern alignment
- Operational overhead


### Daily/Weekly Summary
- Top regressions
- Top improvements
- Top modernization candidates

## Security Model

- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Bedrock invocation scoped using:
  - `bedrock:InvokeModel`
  - `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`
- DynamoDB access through IAM only
- No VPC connectivity required for MVP
- SQS & DDB encrypted by default

## Status

This repository currently contains:
- Architecture diagram
- Scoring model
- Modernization logic explanation

**MVP implementation will be added later.**
