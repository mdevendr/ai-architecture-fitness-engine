# AI-Driven Architecture Fitness & Modernization Score Engine

This repository provides the **architecture-only blueprint** for an AI-powered engine that evaluates cloud workloads and produces modernization and fitness scores using AWS-native signals and Amazon Bedrock.

## 1. Overview

The engine automates architecture review by:
- Analysing workload signals (CloudWatch metrics, Config, Cost Explorer, usage patterns)
- Evaluating modernization opportunities
- Scoring cost efficiency, reliability, resilience, maintainability, and scalability
- Producing AI-driven recommendations using Bedrock
- Triggering periodic evaluations using EventBridge Scheduler
- Orchestrating a multi-step workflow using Step Functions

This repo contains the **architecture** only — *no full implementation is provided yet*.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### Components
- **Cloud Signals Layer** – Autonomous metrics, logs, and config-based signals generated by native AWS services.
- **EventBridge Pipes** – Filters workloads based on important signal changes.
- **Signal Buffer (SQS)** – Stores filtered events for burst protection and durable processing.
- **EventBridge Scheduler** – Triggers periodic full-account analysis.
- **Step Functions (Evaluator & Orchestrator)** – Controls workflow, retries, orchestration, and final scoring.
- **AWS Lambda (AI Orchestrator)** – Calls Amazon Bedrock with workload metadata.
- **Amazon Bedrock** – Produces the modernization score & recommendations.
- **DynamoDB** – Stores evaluation metadata, history, and recommendations.
- **S3** – Stores architecture documents, score reports, exports, and diagrams.

## 3. Workflow

### 3.1 Cloud Signals → EventBridge Pipes
Each workload emits operational, security, and performance signals:
```
CloudWatch → EventBridge Pipe → (Filter + Transform) → SQS
```

### 3.2 Periodic Evaluation
EventBridge Scheduler triggers Step Functions to:
- Pull signals from SQS
- Load architecture metadata from DDB
- Invoke AI analysis
- Store updated scores

### 3.3 AI Processing (Lambda + Bedrock)
Lambda prepares:
- Resource configuration
- Metrics summary
- Historical performance context

Bedrock produces:
- Modernization score (0–100)
- Architecture fitness findings
- Recommended patterns (Serverless, EDA, CQRS, Sidecar, SQS buffering, DAX, etc.)

## 4. Scoring Model

### 4.1 Cost Efficiency
- Idle compute %
- Right-sizing
- Storage lifecycle efficiency
- Data transfer optimisation

### 4.2 Reliability & Resilience
- Multi-AZ readiness
- DR posture
- Error rate trends
- Retry/backoff patterns

### 4.3 Scalability
- Auto scaling policies
- Concurrency behaviour
- Queue depth efficiency
- Burst handling readiness

### 4.4 Maintainability
- Complexity level
- Modularity
- Pattern alignment
- Operational overhead

## 5. Outputs

### 5.1 Architecture Fitness Report
```json
{
  "service": "payment-api",
  "score": 78,
  "issues": [
    "No multi-AZ deployment",
    "High EC2 idle rate",
    "Large retry bursts at peak hours"
  ],
  "recommended_patterns": [
    "Move to Fargate Spot",
    "Introduce SQS buffer",
    "Adopt Strangler migration"
  ]
}
```

### 5.2 Daily/Weekly Summary
- Top regressions
- Top improvements
- Top modernization candidates

## 6. Security Model

- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Bedrock invocation scoped using:
  - `bedrock:InvokeModel`
  - `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`
- DynamoDB access through IAM only
- No VPC connectivity required for MVP
- SQS & DDB encrypted by default
